Create a database

CREATE DATABASE loginapp;

-- Switch to 'loginapp' database; 
USE loginapp; 

-- Create 'account' table with id, username,email, password columns. 
CREATE TABLE accounts (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
); 

Delete image based on user id
DELETE FROM images WHERE user_id = 1;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS images (
  image_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INT NOT NULL,
  image_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  image_path VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  image BLOB,
  metadata TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS audio_library (
  audio_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  audio_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, -- Name of the audio file
  audio_blob MEDIUMBLOB NOT NULL, -- Storing the audio as binary data
  audio_path VARCHAR(255), -- Path to the audio file on the server, if applicable
  metadata TEXT, -- Any additional data you want to store about the audio file
  uploaded_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP -- Timestamp of when the audio was uploaded
);


Make sure that the password, hsot and username you are running the program with is correct. In my case my mysql password is computing@123! and the username is root. This is the corresponding code for it in the python code. Modify according to your system.

app.config['MYSQL_HOST'] = 'localhost'
app.config['MYSQL_USER'] = 'root'
app.config['MYSQL_PASSWORD'] = 'computing@123!'
app.config['MYSQL_DB'] = 'loginapp'

To run the code, execute the following comands in the current working directory which contains the main.py file:

Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
set FLASK_APP=main.py
set FLASK_DEBUG=1 
flask --app main.py run


Here is how you can see if an account  has been updated to the accounts table in the database
SELECT * FROM accounts;

To check if the images have been uploaded correctly (since the SELECT * FROM images WHERE user_id=1; comand prints nonsense as the image is stored as BLOB.)

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM images WHERE user_id=1;
SELECT image_id, LENGTH(image) AS image_size FROM images WHERE user_id=1;

If your images are not updating to the database, first insert an image manually to perform a check using a command dimilar to the following. Replace the image name with theee image you are using. The directory preffered is the Uploads directory under MySQL Server 8.0. Copy your images to the Uploads directory and try inserting to the database
 INSERT INTO images (user_id, image) VALUES (1, LOAD_FILE('C:\\ProgramData\\MySQL\\MySQL Server 8.0\\Uploads\\Screenshot 2023-09-28 143512.png'));
 
To run the program
$env:FLASK_APP="main.py"
$env:FLASK_DEBUG = "1" 
flask run
